Rugix Bakery is part of the [Rugix](https://rugix.org) project, an open-source tool suite for building secure and reliable embedded Linux devices with efficient over-the-air update capabilities.

You wrote your application and now need to integrate it into a full system ready to be flashed onto your device or deployed as an update? Rugix Bakery makes this process (almost) **as easy as writing a Dockerfile, enabling you to focus on what provides value to your users** instead of system-level details.

- Build upon proven distributions such as **Debian and Alpine Linux**.
- **Over-the-air update capabilities** powered by [Rugix Ctrl](https://github.com/rugix/rugix) out of the box.
- Build everything **from source to image in a container-based environment**.
- Define **multiple system variants**, including variants for testing.
- Builtin **system testing framework** and **support for running VMs**.

With Rugix Bakery, you get a **comprehensive tool to build, test, and run your system** similar to what you will find with modern software development tooling, like [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/) (Rust) or [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (Python).

[**Get started today! Build your first system and deploy an update, all in under 30 minutes!**](https://rugix.org/docs/getting-started)
